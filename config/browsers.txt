# Perform these first because they are extremely cheap to perform.
#
Linux,CH,49


#
# Perform these next because IE compatibility is a major
# issue. Finding problems early pays.
#
Windows 8.1,IE,11,Remote

#
# Perform these next because OS X compatibility is an issue. Again, we
# want to find problems early.

# On CH 37, Selenium fails to perform:
# Scenario: removing a paragraph with backspace
# Scenario: removing a paragraph with delete
# The issue seems to be that it cannot click at the start of the
# paragraph.
# OS X 10.9,CH,37,Remote
# wed definitely breaks on Chrome 34.
# OS X 10.6,CH,34,Remote

#
# The rest is unlikely to fail if the previous tests passed.
#
Windows 8.1,CH,49,Remote
# wed definitely breaks on Chrome 34.
# Windows 8.1,CH,34,Remote

#
# FAILING COMBINATIONS
#
# Fails due to a resizing bug in Selenium:
#
# Windows 8.1,FF,26,Remote

#
# FF does not support native events in OS X.
#
# OS X 10.6,FF,..,Remote
