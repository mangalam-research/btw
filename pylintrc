#
# - E1101 is the check that verifies whether object members exist. When using
# Django this check yields too many false positives.
#
# - E1103 is like E1101.
#
# - W0232 also yields too many false positives with Django.
#
# - W0142: Used * or ** magic
#
# - pointless-string-statement is raised for the documentation of object
# attributes because the string appears after the attribute.
#
# - catching-non-exception is raised because some Django exceptions are
# created like this:
#
# class Error(Exception if six.PY3 else StandardError):
#     pass
#
# And it confuses pylint.
