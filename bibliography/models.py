# This is an arbitrary limit on the size of a Zotero URL fragment that
# uniquely identifies a Zotero entry.
#
# The URL contains:
#
# /users/<userID>/items/<itemKey>
#
# and a key=<APIkey> parameter which contains a key to access the
# user's data.
#
# - <userID> is 10 digits long (see master.sql in zotero-dataserver's
#   code).
#
# - <itemKey> is 8 chars long (see shard.sql in zotero-dataserver's
#  code).
#
# - <APIKey> is 24 chars long (see master.sql in the Zotero server
#  code.)
#
# For accessing groups the scheme is the same except that the URL
# fragment contains "/groups/<groupID>". A <groupID> has the same
# format as a <userID>. Internally, we ALWAYS store a <userID> with
# the "u" prefix and a <groupID> with the "g" prefix.
#
# We double the values below to build some slack into the system.
