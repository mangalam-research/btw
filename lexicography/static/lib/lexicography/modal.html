        <p>Unpublishing should be done only under very special
          circumstances. There is <strong>no need</strong> to unpubish
          an old version of an article <strong>merely</strong> because
          you are publishing a newer version.</p>
        <p>Generally, you should unpublish only as a matter of law or
          ethics (for instance, the article used copyrighted material
          without permission).</p>
        <p>If you have just published a version of an article and want
          to unpublish it right away, this is fine.</p>
